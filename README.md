# Conveyor-System-using-Beckhoff-TwinCAT
Hi All, this is a program that simulates a packing station on a manufacturing floor using Beckhoff technologies.
Developed a simple pick and place program using Beckhoff Servo and Stepper motors controlled by Beckhoff Embedded PCs, CX 5120 Series.
This program consists of different function blocks that were coded in structured text, and it runs a motion point to point library. 

Finding the main program:
1. Select "Motion Program" 
2. Click on "Untitled1" 
3. Click on "POUs"
4. Lastly select "MAIN.TcPOU".

The sequence is: Conveyor-System-using-Beckhoff-TwinCAT/Conveyor System/Motion Program/Untitled1/POUs/MAIN.TcPOU
